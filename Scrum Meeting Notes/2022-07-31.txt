Denny
Tasks Done: Finished making 4 new UI
Created UI for add venue form fill out
Created UI for add event form fill out and connected spinner to backend
Created UI for venue page
Created UI for venue description page
Jacky
Tasks Done: rename sort by venue to filter by venue to distinguish between the features.
Focus on working with sorting features for lists and data validation for classes if possible (upcoming events should be by filter, venues should be by sorting).
Klein
Tasks Done: Added delete event and remove user from event functions and buttons to profile page, also fixed bugs when merging.
TODO: fix upcoming merge issues and make code interact with new User class
Anthony
Tasks Done: 
Added ability for Admins to view and edit created venues
We are now able to track session data and also login and stuff
Seven 
Tasks Done: Did some refactoring on the code, could not figure out how to make sure my changes don’t break the program (because can’t test/run the app). Solution: Trust me. 
Continue to refactor code and work on tasks with Anthony with his and my sprint stuff.
Still need to redirect Admins to a different page and logging out and make certain changes for efficiency in the User database
