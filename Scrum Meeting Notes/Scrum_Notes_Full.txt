Discussion between Anthony and Klein (outside of scrum meeting):
* Problem: in venues with multiple “courts” (places where sports can happen) it is possible for customers to have overlapping events of different types
   * Solution: Separate venues into different courts, for instance, Pan-am’s gyms and pool will be treated as 2 different venues.
      * Each court will have a parameter which dictates how many concurrent events can occur there at a time.
      * Each court will have a list of possible sports which can be played there




        *Extra Note about availability: court’s will have a parameter which indicates which days of the week it is available for events. An “availableFrom” and “availableTo” variable is used to represent what time the venue is available on these days. This time period cannot be modulated throughout the week as that will take too much work on our part.

🚨IMPORTANT NOTE🚨 from Seven Jang (1008078768) to Prof. Rawad and TA Alejandro:
*  As Posted on the B07 Piazza Forum, on   question  @180, the android emulator only works less than half the time and running android studio gave me many many blue screens (BSoD), making it very difficult for me to work on the project 
   * After exploring many options, Alejandro and I were unable to fix it (Ex. reinstalling everything)
* As such, I opted to just using Visual Studio, for doing tasks that don’t require me to  test my code  (because I was unable to run it on the emulator)
* Another thing that I’ve done is that I got some of my Team Members to share their screen while they were working on the Project, so that I could help them with their Sprint instead (ex. Anthony would share his screen on Discord while he worked on the project and I would help him)
   * This was to hopefully “ make up for ” the work I was unable to do because of the blue screens
* Another note is that on the SCRUM Notes, it mentioned that I was “ on a trip ” from August 1 - 4. 
   * What this was, was an important four day gathering for this belief called 道 (Tao)
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao  for reference
   * This is why I skipped four SCRUM meetings
* I have already explained my situation and explored accommodation options with Alejandro
