üö®IMPORTANT NOTEüö® from Seven Jang (1008078768) to Prof. Rawad and TA Alejandro:
 As Posted on the B07 Piazza Forum, on   question  @180, the android emulator only works less than half the time and running android studio gave me many many blue screens (BSoD), making it very difficult for me to work on the project 
After exploring many options, Alejandro and I were unable to fix it (Ex. reinstalling everything)
As such, I opted to just using Visual Studio, for doing tasks that don‚Äôt require me to test my code  (because I was unable to run it on the emulator)
Another thing that I‚Äôve done is that I got some of my Team Members to share their screen while they were working on the Project, so that I could help them with their Sprint instead (ex. Anthony would share his screen on Discord while he worked on the project and I would help him)
This was to hopefully ‚Äú make up for ‚Äù the work I was unable to do because of the blue screens
Another note is that on the SCRUM Notes, it mentioned that I was ‚Äú on a trip ‚Äù from August 1 - 4. 
What this was, was an important four day gathering for this belief called ÈÅì (Tao)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao  for reference (not a religion)
This is why I skipped four SCRUM meetings
I have already explained my situation and explored accommodation options with Alejandro
